## Goal

> Make my life easier when setting up a machine.

## Prerequisites on an Ubuntu based machine

```bash
# Add Ansible and Git
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install ansible git software-properties-common pinentry-tty
```

## Setup an Ubuntu based machine

```bash
# Get the dotfiles
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/cumpsd/dotfiles.git <your preferred location>/dotfiles
cd <your preferred location>/dotfiles

# Setup the system
./setup-system

# In case you want to have a GUI, run the following instead:
./setup-system --with-gui

# At this point, it might be needed to explicitly run fisher and Oh My Fish! to get our shell setup
fish
fisher
# fish/oh-my-fish/bin/install --offline
omf install
fish_update_completions
```

## Setup GPG

```bash
# Import our existing GPG keys
gpg2 --import <key>

# Trust our imported key
gpg --edit-key user@domain.com

gpg> trust

Please decide how far you trust this user to correctly verify other users' keys
(by looking at passports, checking fingerprints from different sources, etc.)

  1 = I don't know or won't say
  2 = I do NOT trust
  3 = I trust marginally
  4 = I trust fully
  5 = I trust ultimately
  m = back to the main menu

Your decision? 5
And don't forget to save the changes:

gpg> save

# Unlock the dotfiles repo
git-crypt unlock

# Use SSH for remote
git remote set-url origin git@github.com:cumpsd/dotfiles.git

# At this point you can clone all the repos by running:
repos/setup.sh
```
